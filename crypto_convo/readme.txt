Creating a decentralized cryptocurrency that could disintermediate the US economy from the fiat currency central banking system is a complex task. Here are some characteristics that such a system would likely need to have:

Decentralization: The system should be fully decentralized, meaning that no single entity has control over the entire network. This is a fundamental characteristic of cryptocurrencies and is what allows them to operate independently of traditional financial institutions.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mechanism: The system should use a PoW consensus algorithm to validate transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. This mechanism requires participants (miners) to solve complex mathematical problems, which helps to secure the network and prevent fraudulent activity.

Security: The system should have robust security measures in place to prevent hacking and fraud. This includes cryptographic security, which ensures that transactions are secure and cannot be altered once they have been added to the blockchain.

Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large volume of transactions quickly and efficiently. This is a significant challenge for many existing cryptocurrencies, and solving it would be crucial for a cryptocurrency aiming to replace a national economy's financial system.

Stability: The system should have mechanisms in place to maintain price stability. Cryptocurrencies are often subject to significant price volatility, which could be a barrier to their use as a stable store of value.

Usability: The system should be user-friendly and accessible to all citizens. This includes having a simple and intuitive interface, as well as being easily accessible for people without advanced technical knowledge.

Interoperability: The system should be able to interact with other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial systems. This would allow for seamless transactions between different types of currencies and financial institutions.

Regulatory Compliance: While the system would operate independently of the central banking system, it would still need to comply with relevant financial regulations. This could include regulations related to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) procedures.

Privacy: The system should ensure the privacy of its users while also maintaining transparency in its operations. This could involve using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, which allow for the verification of transactions without revealing the details of those transactions.

Sustainability: Given the environmental concerns associated with PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the system should aim to minimize its environmental impact. This could involve using renewable energy sources for mining operations or implementing more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms.

Incentive Structure: The system should have an incentive structure that encourages participation and maintains the security and integrity of the system. This could involve rewarding miners with new coins for validating transactions and creating new blocks.

Adoption: The system should have a clear plan for encouraging widespread adoption. This could involve partnerships with businesses and financial institutions, public education campaigns, and efforts to ensure the system can be used for everyday transactions.

As for creating a scaffold for a system to run secure wallets on low-cost, open source microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP32, it's important to note that these devices have limited computational power and memory, which could make them unsuitable for heavy cryptographic operations. However, they could potentially be used as interfaces to a more powerful system that handles the bulk of the cryptographic work.

Here's a basic outline of how such a system might be structured:

1. **Hardware**: Use a microcontroller like Arduino or ESP32 as the user interface. This device could be used to enter transaction details and display account information.

2. **Communication**: The microcontroller would need a secure method of communicating with the outside world. This could be accomplished using a secure, encrypted wireless connection.

3. **Wallet Software**: The wallet software would be responsible for creating and managing the user's private keys, creating transactions, and communicating with the cryptocurrency network. Given the limited resources of the microcontroller, this software would likely need to run on a separate, more powerful device.

4. **Cryptocurrency Network Interface**: The system would need a way to communicate with the cryptocurrency network. This could involve running a full node on a separate device, or using a lightweight client that connects to an external node.

5. **Security**: Security is crucial in any cryptocurrency system. The system would need to securely store the user's private keys, securely communicate with the cryptocurrency network, and protect against physical and digital attacks.

6. **User Interface**: The user interface would allow the user to create and sign transactions, view their balance, and monitor the status of their transactions. This could be implemented on the microcontroller using a simple display and input buttons.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and implementing such a system would require significant technical expertise. It's also important to consider the security implications of such a system, as microcontrollers may not provide the same level of security as more traditional computing platforms.

Please note that this is a theoretical exercise and implementing such a system would involve significant technical, regulatory, and societal challenges.
